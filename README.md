# pcc

This project was created as a practical assistant for trip, vacation or teavel cash calculating.<br>
The logic of this project is simple: the cash-on-hands amount is detailed in the trip description<br> 
by the user for the entire period of the trip.<br>
The application calculates the trip days total number, the days left number and recommends the average <br>
cash-on-hand amount that the user can spend per day without losing his budget.<br>
